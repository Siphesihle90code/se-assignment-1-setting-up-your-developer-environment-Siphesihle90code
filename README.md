                         git init
   


4. Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes:
  Instal Python from http://wwww.python.org programming language required for your project and install their respective compilers, interpreters, or runtimes. Ensure you have the necessary tools to build and execute your code.
  T o install Python from the official Python website you must follow these steps:
  1.1 Visit the Python website:go to www.python.org.
  1.2 Select the downloads tab:click on the"Downloads" tab.
  1.3 Choose your operating system: select the appropriate option for your operating system(Windows,Mac,Linux)
  1.4 Download the installer for your chosen operating system.
  1.5 Run the installer :run the installer and follow the prompts to complete the installation.
  1.6 Verify the installation: open a terminal or command prompt and type python --version to confirm that Python is installed correctly.

5. Install Package Managers:
   If applicable, install package managers like pip (Python).
   To install package managers like pip:
   1.1. Check if pip is already installed ,open terminal or command promprt and type pip --version. If pip is installed you'll see a version number.
   1.2 Install pip, if pip is not installed you can download the installation script from the official Python websie.
   1.3 Run the script ,save the script to your computer and run it using Pyton.
   1.4 Verity installation, once installed check the version again pip --version.

6. Configure a Database (MySQL):
   Download and install MySQL database. https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html
